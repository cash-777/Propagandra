Propigandro is a machine learning-based tool for detecting propaganda in text. Propaganda refers to biased or manipulative communication intended to influence an audience. This project aims to classify text as either propaganda or non-propaganda by using machine learning techniques to recognize patterns and features indicative of biased or manipulative content.
